# Conoa Interview tests 

We want know how you tried to solve these tasks. There are multiple ways to solve them.

Good luck!

## Instructions

- You'll need a k8s cluster (local or remote, doesn't matter). If you don't have a local or remote cluster we can recommend [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/).
- You can start with task 1 and 2. Task 3 is optional and similar as task 2 but with a small difference. 
- Now go into each task folder for task specific instructions.

## Tasks

Go into the folders, follow instructions.

1. [deployment](deployment)
1. [hello01](hello01)
