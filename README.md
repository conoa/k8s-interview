# Conoa Interview tests 

We want know how you tried to sovle these taks.

Good luck!

## Prerequisites
You'll need a k8s cluster (local or remote, doesn't matter). You don't need to spend more than 30-60 minutes in total on the tasks. All tasks might not be solvable or are they?? :-)
If you don't have a local or remote cluster we can recommend [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/).
